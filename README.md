**Book Search and Recommending System**

Developed a book search and recommender system, so that users can search information about books, and also get a recommendation by answering guiding questions regarding preferred genre, rating, author, popularity, etc.
We limit the responses to 10 books at a time.

We noticed challenges in combining databases when not all fields had values, and where databases would not always share the same fields. We opted to creating separate databases to fit the queries that are most applicable to them.
